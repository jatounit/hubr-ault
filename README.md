Full credit to rainkeebs for the original Hubris design (among others) and much appreciation for their original decison to release under Unlicense.

Top mount case for Vault35 pcbs. Like the original, it has a 5 degree angle and a front height of ~20mm.

Uses 10x m2.5x4(ish)mm screws, a custom plate based on the coriander plate, and [SKUF Keyboard feet](https://github.com/Zambumon/SKUF), availible from several vendors worldwide.

As of the date this is last updated these files have been tested with a CNC milled top, an SLA printed transparent resin bottom, and an SLA printed plate.
