OMEGA credit to Blind_Panda for the techinical drawing of this! Amazing work there.

Top mount case for Minivan pcbs. Has a 5 degree angle and a front height of ~20mm.

Uses 10x m2.5x4(ish)mm screws, [coriander plate](https://trashman.wiki/en/files), and [PrimeKB Feet](https://www.primekb.com/products/bumpons) or [P3D Feet](https://p3dstore.com/products/laser-cut-cork-bumpons)

As of the date this is last updated these files have been tested with FDM and SLA 3D printing and CNC milling. I don't recommend getting this SLA printed, when I did they warped a ton. YMMV, but that was my experience. FDM printing works great however!
